            <h2>Hi there</h2>
            <p>I'm a Fullstack Web Developer

                But apart from programming, I really like playing soccer, spending time with friends or family, and cooking (I also have a degree in gastronomy and haute cuisine).

                I consider myself an independent person,
                sociable, hard-working and respectful.

                I like to participate in group projects with people who add value, pleasant experiences, and who help me in my continuous learning process in this world of programming.</p>
